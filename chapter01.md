Chapter 1. Introduction to Polari
=================================

What is Polari?
---------------

Welcome to the world of Polari (aka. Karny, Palare, Parlary, Palarie or Palari)! This book is designed to help you learn and master the unique and fascinating language of Polari. But what is Polari, and why is it worth learning?

Polari is a secret language that originated in the British LGBT community in the late 19th century. Over time, Polari developed into a rich and expressive language, full of colourful slang, expressions, and wordplay.

In addition to being a secret code, Polari also served as a way for LGBT people to build community and connect with each other in a world that often rejected and discriminated against them. In fact, Polari was so important to the LGBT community that it became an integral part of their culture and identity.

Today, Polari is enjoying a resurgence of interest and popularity. It is being used in entertainment and media and celebrated as an important part of LGBT history and culture. By learning Polari, you'll not only be mastering a unique and fascinating language, but you'll also be connecting with a rich and vibrant cultural heritage.

This book will guide you through the basics of Polari vocabulary, grammar, and conversation. You'll learn how to introduce yourself and make small talk. You will not learn how to order food & drinks though (Polari would have been used to discreetly discus your fellow drinkers/diners and the waiters rather than to actively order food & drinks).

You'll also explore the history and culture of Polari with our tour guides Julian & Sandy and discover how it fits into the larger context of LGBT history and culture.

Whether you're a language enthusiast, an LGBT history buff, or simply curious about this unique and expressive language, this book is the perfect guide to help you learn and master the art of Polari. So, let's get started!

Julian and Sandy: The Trial of Oscar Wild
-----------------------------------------
As Julian and Sandy led the tourists through the winding streets of London, they arrived at a mysterious blue box. "This, Gillies and Flatties, is the Montrell Cheat," Julian exclaimed, as they stepped inside. "It's our means of traveling through time and space, darling!" Sandy added, twirling his moustache.

The tourists looked at each other with a mixture of excitement and confusion.

"Time and space?" one of them asked.

"Yes, my dear! We are here with the illustrious Crocus, who has kindly lent us his Montrel Cheat (Time Vehicle)," Sandy said, indicating the room inside the box.Â  The interior of the Montrel Cheat was surprisingly spacious, and the tourists looked around in amazement as Julian and Sandy fussed about, checking buttons and switches.

"Sorry for the delay, Gillies & Flatties, we won't be long," Julian said in an aside to Sandy.

"What did the Crocus say?" Sandy asked, with a shrug.

"Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey," Julian said with a sigh. "I tell you; these Montrel Duchesses have a language all their own."

The Montrell Cheat hummed and whirred as it transported the group through time and space, arriving at the Old Bailey in 1895. "We've arrived, Gillies and Flatties," Julian announced.

As we stepped out of the Montrel Cheat, Julian and Sandy led us down the bustling streets of Victorian London. We were on our way to witness one of the most significant moments in LGBT+ history - the trial of Oscar Wilde.

Julian explained how Wilde's trial was the catalyst for the adoption of Polari in the LGBT+ community. As the trial caused a massive increase in homophobia, the LGBT+ community was forced underground. They needed a secret language to communicate with each other, and Polari was perfect for the job.

Sandy chimed in, "Yes, and did you know that Oscar Wilde used to wear a green carnation as a symbol of his homosexuality?"

We arrived at the Old Bailey, where the trial was to take place. As we entered the courtroom, Julian and Sandy pointed out the various members of the court and explained what they were saying in Polari.

As the trial began, we listened to the prosecution make their case against Wilde. The judge was harsh, and it was clear that the outcome of the trial would be a foregone conclusion.

Julian leaned in and whispered, "It's so sad that they're doing this to him. He doesn't deserve it."

Sandy nodded in agreement. "It's a terrible thing, Gillies & Flatties, but at least we're here to witness history in the making."

As the trial went on, we saw the evidence mount against Wilde, and it became clear that he was going to be found guilty. When the verdict was read, the courtroom erupted in gasps and whispers.

Julian turned to us and said, "This is a dark day for the LGBT+ community. But we must remember that Wilde's trial and the adoption of Polari were crucial moments in our history. They paved the way for future generations to be themselves and love who they love."

We left the courtroom feeling sombre but also grateful for the opportunity to witness such an important event. As we stepped back into the Montrel Cheat, Sandy turned to us and said, "Well, that was a heavy trip. How about we go somewhere and get a bevvy to lighten the mood?"
