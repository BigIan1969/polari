Julian & Sandy: Visit the fairground.
-------------------------------------

Julian and Sandy invite us once again on a time-traveling adventure through the Montrel Cheat, this time taking us to a 1950s British fairground. They explain that fairgrounds and circuses were hotbeds of Polariyarie (or Carnie), the language that gave birth to Polari.

As we walk through the bustling fairground, we hear snippets of conversation from the workers. A burly man with a thick moustache approaches us, calling out, "Wanna have a butcher's at me wares, ducks?" Sandy leans in and whispers, "He's offering to show you his goods, love."

We walk past a group of workers huddled around a game stall. "Ere, that bloke's a right lag," one of them says, pointing at a man in a striped shirt. Julian leans over and tells us, "They're saying that man is a dishonest cheater."

As we continue our tour, we hear more and more Polariyarie being spoken. "Look at that riah on him!" a woman calls out as a man with flamboyant hair walks past. Julian explains, "She's saying he has fabulous hair."

As we approach a ride, a worker calls out to us, "Troll right up, have a go on the Carousel." Sandy explains, "He's inviting us to ride the Carousel."

We ride the Carousel and watch as the fairground workers continue to speak in their secret language. Julian and Sandy point out different words and phrases to us, and we begin to get a better understanding of how Polariyarie influenced the development of Polari.

As we return to the present day, Julian and Sandy bid us farewell and encourage us to continue exploring the rich history and unique language of the British fairgrounds and circuses.
