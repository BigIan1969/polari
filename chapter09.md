Today, Polari is often used for comedic effect in television shows, movies, and theatrical productions. It is also still used by some drag performers, comedians, and musicians as a way to connect with LGBTQ+ audiences and pay homage to queer culture.

## Julian & Sandy: Bona Nochy

As the Montrell Cheat shuddered to a stop, we found ourselves back in the present day, our journey with Julian and Sandy coming to an end. The familiar wheeze of the time-traveling device ceased, and we knew it was time to bid farewell to our beloved tour guides.

Julian and Sandy stood before us; their faces adorned with warm smiles that mirrored the bittersweet emotions in our hearts. Their journey with us had been filled with laughter, knowledge, and a deeper understanding of the struggles faced by the LGBTQ+ community throughout history.

"We've reached the end of our marvellous adventure, my dears," Julian announced, his voice filled with a mixture of pride and sadness. "We hope that our tour has opened your eyes to the battles fought and the progress made in the fight for equality and inclusion."

Sandy nodded, his eyes twinkling with fondness. "Indeed, it has been a pleasure to share this journey with you. Remember, the knowledge and understanding you've gained here today can be a powerful force for change in your own lives and communities."

Julian's voice took on a reflective tone. "Just as the Gay Liberation Front and countless others paved the way for us, it is now our turn to carry the torch of progress. Each of you has the power to make a difference, to champion equality and fight against injustice."

Sandy added, his voice filled with hope, "Take what you've learned, the stories and experiences shared, and let them guide you in creating a world that embraces diversity, love, and acceptance."

We nodded; our hearts filled with gratitude for the invaluable journey we had embarked upon. The Montrell Cheat had transported us through time, but it was the wisdom and passion of Julian and Sandy that had truly opened our eyes.

As we stepped out of the shabby blue box, Julian and Sandy ushered us gently, their words lingering in the air. "Make the most of what you've learned, my dears. Remember, progress is not a destination but an ongoing journey. Go forth and be champions of equality, inclusion, and love."

With a final wave and a heartfelt goodbye, Julian and Sandy watched as we merged back into the bustling present, carrying the spirit of our journey with us. The Montrell Cheat disappeared with a slight rheumatic wheeze, leaving us with memories and a renewed commitment to making a difference.
