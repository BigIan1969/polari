Chapter 2. Polari Vocabulary
============================

Basic Polari words and phrases
------------------------------

Polari is a language that was often used by marginalized communities, including LGBT people, in order to communicate with each other without fear of persecution or discrimination. As a result, it is a language that is rich in innuendo, slang, and coded language.

One interesting aspect of Polari is that many speakers actually only knew a small subset of the language but were able to infer the meanings of other words and phrases based on context and innuendo. This meant that even if you only knew a handful of Polari words, you could still communicate effectively with other speakers and understand what they were saying.

Here are some basic Polari words and phrases that were commonly used:

- Bona -- Good, Nice.

- Vada -- See, To See, Look.

- "Bona Vada" -- Nice to see you.

- Dolly -- Pretty, Attractive.

- Eek, Ecaf -- Face.

- "Bona vada your dolly old eek" -- Nice to see your pretty old face (Traditional Polari Greeting).

- Ajax -- Nearby, Here.

- Cod, Catever, Kerterver -- Bad, Tacky, Gross, Vile

- NAFF -- Drab, Dull or a Heterosexual.

- Lattie -- Room, House, Flat, Abode.

- Doss -- Bed, Place to sleep.

- Nanti -- No, Not, Non.

- Omi -- Man.

- Palone -- Woman.

- Riah -- Hair.

- Zhoosh -- Stylise, Smarten, Stylish.

- TBH -- To Be Had (Sexually available).

- Trade -- Sex.

- Troll -- To Walk About (Looking for trade).

As you can see, many of these words and phrases have double meanings or hidden connotations that would have been immediately recognizable to other Polari speakers.

This aspect of Polari made it an incredibly powerful tool for communication among LGBT people and other marginalized groups, and it continues to be an important part of LGBT history and culture today.

Pronunciation guide
-------------------

Pronunciation is an essential aspect of learning any language, and Polari is no exception. While Polari is based on English pronunciation, what distinguishes it is the manner in which it is spoken - often in a hushed whisper or with an exaggerated, theatrical tone. This is referred to as "high camp".

When you speak Polari, you may experiment with various levels of hyper camp to express different emotions or emphasize certain words. For instance, a phrase like "bona vada" (good to see you) could be spoken in a quiet, seductive tone, or with a loud, theatrical flourish.

Little can be gleaned on how many words were spoken except for "Bona" which occurs regularly in Round the Horne.  When the word bona is applied to an object it's pronounced bona as in bonnet, however, when it's applied to a person such as the greeting "Bona vada your dolly old eek" it's pronounced Bone.

To perfect your pronunciation of Polari, the most effective approach is to practice. Speak Polari phrases out loud, trying different hyper camp levels to find the right tone. Remember to have fun with it - Polari is a lively, expressive language that is intended to be enjoyed.

Polari slang and expressions
----------------------------

Polari is a rich and colourful language, full of slang and expressions. Here are some commonly used words and phrases:

- Bona: Good, nice, excellent.

- Camp: Over-the-top, effeminate, flamboyant.

- Charpering: Eavesdropping, lurking around.

- Dish: An attractive man or buttocks.

- Drag: Clothing or outfit.

- Gelt: Money.

- Khazi: Toilet.

Please note that some words in Polari have multiple meanings, depending on the context in which they are used. For example, "naff" can mean dull or inferior, but it can also refer to someone who is straight. Similarly, "dish" can refer to an attractive man, or to the buttocks.

Polari has drawn on a variety of languages, including Yiddish, Italian, Cockney Rhyming Slang, and Romani, to create its unique vocabulary and expressions.

As you continue your Polari language learning journey, keep in mind that this is just a small sample of the rich and vibrant language of Polari.

Common Polari words used in everyday conversation.
--------------------------------------------------

In addition to the unique slang and expressions that make up Polari, there are also many everyday words that are commonly used in conversation. Here are some of the most common Polari words that you might hear:

These words may seem strange or even offensive to some people, but they were once an important part of the underground culture of LGBT communities in the UK. Learning these words can help you to better understand the history and culture of Polari, as well as to communicate with those who still use this unique language today.

Julian & Sandy: The Black Cat Café
----------------------------------

The group of tourists gathered around Julian and Sandy as they stood outside the Black Cat Cafe in Old Compton Street. Julian, with his flamboyant demeanour and Sandy, with his playful quips, greeted the group with a warm smile.

"Welcome, welcome, my dears!" Julian said, with a wave of his hand. "We are your tour guides for today, and we will be taking you on a journey through time and space!"

As the Montrel Cheat hummed to life, the tourists gripped each other tightly, unsure of what to expect. Suddenly, there was a jolt, and the world around them disappeared.

When the Montrel Cheat finally came to a stop, Julian and Sandy ushered the tourists out into the Old Compton Street of 1963. The street was alive with activity, and the Black Cat Cafe stood proudly on the corner.

"Welcome to Old Compton Street, dears," says Julian. "This is where all the action happens!"

Sandy chimes in, "Yes, and we're here to give you a tour of the famous Black Cat Cafe. It's the heart of Polari culture, you know."

As we walk towards the cafe, Julian explains, "The Black Cat Cafe was a safe haven for the LGBTQ+ community, where they could socialize and use Polari without fear of persecution. It was a place where we could be ourselves and not have to hide our true identity."

Sandy adds, "Yes, and it was also a place where we could enjoy a nice cuppa and a bite to eat."

We arrive at the cafe and Julian opens the door, welcoming us in. "This is where it all happened, dears," he says, "The Black Cat Cafe was a place of liberation and acceptance for so many people."

They then led us inside, where the air was thick with the aroma of strong coffee and cigarette smoke. As they walked through the crowded tables, Julian and Sandy pointed out the famous patrons of the cafe, including Quentin Crisp, Derek Jarman, and Joe Orton.

"Now, if you look over there," Julian gestured towards a corner table, "that's where Mr. Orton used to sit with his lover, the artist Kenneth Halliwell. They were quite the pair, always causing a bit of a stir."

Sandy chimed in, "And just over yonder, you might see the likes of Francis Bacon or Lucian Freud, having a chat and a cuppa."

As they made their way to the back of the cafe, Julian and Sandy paused in front of a framed photo on the wall. It was a picture of themselves, taken years ago when they used to perform at the cafe as part of the Round the Horn radio show.

"And here's a little piece of history," Sandy said, pointing to the photo. "That's us, Julian and Sandy, back when we were the darlings of the cafe. We used to entertain the crowd with our bawdy jokes and outrageous costumes."

As we sit down at one of the tables, Sandy hands us a menu. "Now, you must try our famous Polari pudding," he says with a wink. "It's absolutely divine!"

As we chatted, we overheard some of the patrons. They spoke in code, using phrases like "vada the bona dish" (look at the attractive man) and "palone" (woman) to communicate.

Julian and Sandy noticed our interest and explained the history of Polari, telling us about the oppression that the queer community faced in those days and how they had to develop their own language to protect themselves. They also shared some of their favourite Polari phrases, which had us all in stitches.

- "Bona to vada" - Good to see you.

- "Crimping the riah" -- Styling the hair.

- "Vada the dolly dish" - Look at the pretty man.

- "Bijou" - Small and elegant

- "Naff" -- Bad, not good or a straight person

- "Lilly Law" -- The Police

- "Zhoosh" - To style or make something look more attractive.

- "Fantabulosa" - Fantastic or amazing

- "Bona notchy" -Goodnight

- "Palone" -- Woman

- "Omi" - Man

As we enjoy our tea and pudding, Julian and Sandy regale us with stories of the cafe and its patrons. We can't help but feel grateful for this experience and the opportunity to learn more about Polari and its history.

As we prepare to leave, Julian and Sandy bid us farewell. "We hope you've enjoyed your visit to the Black Cat Cafe, dears. Remember to keep Polari alive and always be proud of who you are!"
