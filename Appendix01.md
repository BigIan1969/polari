Friends of Dorothy
------------------

The "Friends of Dorothy" is a recognition system that has been used within the LGBT+ community as a subtle way of identifying fellow community members, particularly in times and places where open expression of one's identity was not safe or accepted. While the phrase is often associated with the character Dorothy from "The Wizard of Oz," there is evidence to suggest that its origin may lie with the renowned writer and socialite, Dorothy Parker. This appendix explores the alternative theory and highlights the influence of Judy Garland as a gay icon.

### Introduction

#### Brief overview of the "Friends of Dorothy" recognition system.

The "Friends of Dorothy" recognition system is a historically significant phrase within the LGBT+ community. It served as a discreet means of identification and connection for individuals who shared a common understanding and acceptance of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.

The phrase "Friends of Dorothy" referred to individuals who identified as LGBT+ and sought to discreetly signal their affiliation within the community. It was used as a way to establish a connection or initiate a conversation, particularly in environments where open expression of one's sexual orientation or gender identity was unsafe or discouraged.

While commonly attributed to the character Dorothy Gale from "The Wizard of Oz," the true origins of the phrase can be traced back to the 20th-century speakeasies in New York City. Dorothy Parker, a prominent writer and socialite, ran exclusive speakeasies for gay men and used the phrase "I'm a friend of Dorothy" as a password to grant entry and foster a safe space for the community.

The "Friends of Dorothy" recognition system became a symbol of resilience, solidarity, and acceptance within the LGBT+ community. It provided a way for individuals to discreetly identify themselves and find support in a world where their identities were often marginalized or stigmatized.

By understanding the historical significance and cultural influence of the "Friends of Dorothy" recognition system, we gain insight into the experiences, struggles, and triumphs of the LGBT+ community throughout history.

This brief overview provides a glimpse into the importance of the "Friends of Dorothy" recognition system as a discreet method of identification and connection within the LGBT+ community, and its historical roots in providing a safe space for individuals during times of discrimination and marginalization.

#### Importance of discreet identification within the LGBT+ community.

Within the LGBT+ community, the importance of discreet identification cannot be understated. For many years, individuals who identified as LGBT+ faced significant challenges, discrimination, and even persecution due to societal norms and legal restrictions. In such a climate, finding like-minded individuals and establishing connections became essential for support, solidarity, and a sense of belonging.

The "Friends of Dorothy" recognition system emerged as a response to the need for discreet identification within the LGBT+ community. In an era when being open about one's sexual orientation or gender identity was often met with hostility or even danger, finding ways to connect with others who shared similar experiences and struggles became crucial.

By using coded language and symbols, such as the phrase "Friends of Dorothy," LGBT+ individuals could discreetly identify themselves to potential allies and community members. This discreet identification allowed for the creation of safe spaces, where individuals could freely express themselves, share stories, and find understanding without fear of judgment or persecution.

Discreet identification provided a lifeline for many within the LGBT+ community, enabling them to navigate hostile environments and connect with supportive individuals. It created a sense of solidarity, where a simple phrase or gesture could convey acceptance, understanding, and a shared bond of experiences.

Moreover, discreet identification fostered a sense of resilience and empowerment. It allowed individuals to reclaim their identities and find strength in the face of adversity. In a world that often dismissed or marginalized the experiences of LGBT+ individuals, discreet identification provided a means to assert their presence, challenge societal norms, and work towards greater acceptance and equality.

While times have changed, and progress has been made towards LGBTQ+ rights and visibility, the historical significance of discreet identification within the LGBT+ community should not be forgotten. Recognizing the importance of these coded systems, like the "Friends of Dorothy," reminds us of the struggles faced by previous generations and the resilience they demonstrated in creating communities of support and understanding.

In conclusion, discreet identification played a vital role within the LGBT+ community, providing a means for individuals to connect, find support, and establish safe spaces. The "Friends of Dorothy" recognition system stands as a testament to the resourcefulness and resilience of the community during times of oppression and marginalization. By understanding and honouring this history, we recognize the journey towards equality and inclusion, and we continue to strive for a world where all individuals can openly express their identities without fear or discrimination.

### The Origins: Dorothy Parker's Speakeasys

#### Introduction to Dorothy Parker and her significance in LGBT+ history.

Dorothy Parker, a renowned American writer, poet, and social critic, holds a significant place in LGBT+ history due to her association with the "Friends of Dorothy" recognition system. While the phrase "Friends of Dorothy" is often attributed to the character Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, its origins actually trace back to Dorothy Parker herself and her role in New York's LGBTQ+ community during the early 20th century.

Parker, known for her wit and sharp tongue, established speakeasies in New York City that were exclusively for gay men. These underground venues provided a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community to gather, socialize, and express themselves freely at a time when homosexuality was heavily stigmatized and persecuted. Parker's speakeasies became legendary, and the password to gain entry was famously known as "I'm a friend of Dorothy."

By using this discreet recognition system, Parker created an environment where LGBTQ+ individuals could gather without fear of persecution or exposure. The phrase "I'm a friend of Dorothy" acted as a signal, allowing people to connect with one another and find solace in a community that understood their struggles and experiences.

Parker's speakeasies were more than just places for socializing; they served as havens for a community that faced marginalization and discrimination. In these spaces, individuals could freely express their identities, build friendships, and form support networks. Parker's contribution to the LGBTQ+ community went beyond her literary achievements, as she actively created spaces where queer individuals could find acceptance and understanding.

Furthermore, Parker's association with the "Friends of Dorothy" recognition system highlights her status as a prominent ally to the LGBTQ+ community. While she herself was not openly queer, her involvement in creating safe spaces for gay men demonstrates her empathy and support for the community. Parker's speakeasies provided a lifeline for many individuals who were marginalized and excluded from mainstream society.

#### Discussion of the use of "I'm a friend of Dorothy" as a password in her speakeasys.

The adoption of "I'm a friend of Dorothy" as a password in Dorothy Parker's speakeasys marked a significant turning point in the development of a secret language and recognition system within the LGBT+ community. The phrase served as a shibboleth, a code that allowed individuals to discreetly identify themselves as part of the queer community while avoiding potential exposure to those who were unsympathetic or hostile.

One of the reasons "I'm a friend of Dorothy" became a universal password among the LGBT+ community was its cleverness and subtlety. The phrase, seemingly innocuous on the surface, carried a hidden meaning that only those in the know would understand. By referencing Dorothy, a common name associated with both the iconic character from The Wizard of Oz and Dorothy Parker herself, individuals could quickly identify one another without arousing suspicion.

The use of this password was also a reflection of the prevailing social climate at the time. During the early 20th century, homosexuality was heavily stigmatized, and queer individuals faced the constant fear of persecution and discrimination. By creating a shared language and recognition system, the LGBT+ community could establish a sense of solidarity and support. "I'm a friend of Dorothy" served as a unifying phrase, signalling acceptance, understanding, and belonging.

Moreover, the adoption of this password demonstrates the resourcefulness and resilience of the LGBT+ community in finding ways to communicate and connect with one another despite the oppressive societal conditions. It became a secret code that transcended geographic boundaries and cultural differences, allowing individuals to find safety and companionship wherever they went.

The universal acceptance of "I'm a friend of Dorothy" as a password within the LGBT+ community speaks to the power of shared experiences and the need for a sense of belonging. By uttering these words, individuals were not only gaining entry into a physical space but also accessing a community that understood and validated their identities.

She was seen as someone who not only sympathized with the struggles of the community but embraced and celebrated its members.

#### The symbolic role of her concerts as inclusive spaces.

The film's enduring popularity, coupled with Judy Garland's own status as a gay icon, contributed to the phrase becoming a recognizable code within the LGBTQ+ community.

The Friends of Dorothy and the American Naval Intelligence Service
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

The American Naval Intelligence Service (NIS) and its successor, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), have a troubling history of targeting the LGBTQ+ community under the mistaken belief that its members posed a security threat. In the mid-1970s, the NIS launched a relentless investigation into the local LGBT+ community in Chicago, specifically searching for an individual named Dorothy, whom they erroneously identified as a prominent LGBT+ figure and a local "kingpin." This misguided campaign not only wasted significant resources but also exemplified the systemic persecution faced by the LGBTQ+ community at the hands of law enforcement agencies.

### The Search for Dorothy

Driven by their unfounded suspicions, the NIS allocated over three million dollars in their pursuit of Dorothy. Unbeknownst to them, the name "Dorothy" referenced the recognition system employed within the LGBT+ community, rather than an actual person. "I'm a friend of Dorothy's" served as a coded password used by members of the community to discreetly identify one another. The NIS's lack of awareness regarding this cultural context underscores the deep-seated ignorance and prejudice that fuelled their investigation.

### Persecution and Innuendo

The persecution of LGBT+ individuals within the military justice system was not limited to the NIS but extended to other branches as well. Prosecuting members of the LGBTQ+ community often relied on innuendo and unsubstantiated claims rather than concrete evidence. A mere suggestion of queerness was often sufficient to secure a conviction and result in dishonourable discharge. This practice reflects a glaring injustice, as it perpetuated a climate of fear, secrecy, and discrimination within the armed forces, where individuals were unjustly targeted based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.

### LGBT+ Community as Low Hanging Fruit

The NIS's misguided pursuit of Dorothy and their routine persecution of the LGBT+ community reflects a broader pattern within law enforcement, where individuals perceived as queer were viewed as "low hanging fruit" for detectives eager to bolster their arrest records. The lack of understanding and acceptance within these agencies perpetuated systemic bias and further marginalized an already vulnerable community. The excessive resources allocated to the search for Dorothy reveal the misdirected priorities and the destructive consequences of such discriminatory practices.

### Conclusion

The NIS's investigation into the Friends of Dorothy demonstrates the historical mistreatment and systemic discrimination faced by the LGBTQ+ community at the hands of law enforcement agencies. The squandering of substantial financial resources in pursuit of a fictional character within the community's recognition system serves as a testament to the deep-seated ignorance and bias that permeated society. The unjust prosecution of LGBTQ+ individuals within the military, driven by innuendo rather than substantial evidence, is a stain on the pursuit of justice and equality.

The Friends of Dorothy episode stands as a reminder of the long and ongoing struggle for acceptance, equal rights, and understanding within the LGBTQ+ community. It highlights the importance of challenging and dismantling systemic discrimination, fostering empathy and inclusivity, and ensuring that law enforcement agencies approach investigations with fairness and respect for the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Only through such efforts can we create a more just and inclusive society for all.
