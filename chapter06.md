Chapter 6. Polari Numeracy
==========================

Introduction to Polari Numeracy
-------------------------------

Numeracy is an important aspect of any language or culture, and Polari is no exception.

It's worth noting that Polari numeracy is based on the old British currency system, which was used before the country switched to decimalization in 1971. This is another indication that Polari was largely dying out by the early 1970s, as it was still using an outdated system that was no longer in use by the wider society.

For numbers with multiple digits that don't have a word just call out each individual digit but you can also use dacha for the zeros so 1024 would be "Una Dacha Dewey Quarter" or "Una Nanti Dewey Quarter".

Learning Polari numeracy can be a fun and interesting way to deepen your understanding of this unique language and culture.

Using Numerals in Everyday Conversation
---------------------------------------

Now that you have learned the Polari numerals, you can start using them in your everyday conversations. Here are some examples:

- "I owe you trey quid." (I owe you £3.)

- "I'll meet you at the pub at dewey o'clock." (I'll meet you at the pub at 2 o'clock.)

- "I'll be back in lepta minutes." (I'll be back in 11 minutes.)

- "I have nobber shillings in my pocket." (I have 9 shillings in my pocket.)

- "I have kenza apples in my basket." (I have 12 apples in my basket.)

As you can see, Polari numerals can be used in many different situations, from telling time to shopping at the market. Practice using them in your own conversations to become more comfortable with them.

Julian & Sandy: Polari & Religion
---------------------------------

As the Crocus, Julian, Sandy, and their group of eager tourists made their way to Westcott House, anticipation filled the air. The grandeur of the historic building stood before them, its architecture an impressive testament to the past. Julian adjusted his signature cravat, while Sandy smoothed down his impeccably tailored suit, ready to guide the us through an extraordinary experience.

With a mischievous glint in his eye, Julian turned to Sandy and whispered, "Well, my dear, we're in for a treat today! A Polari Christian ceremony is like nothing our tourists have ever seen before. It's a celebration of diversity and inclusivity, just like us!"

Sandy nodded with a knowing smile. "Absolutely, Julian! The Crocus always takes our tourists on adventures they won't forget. Today, we delve into the rich heritage of Polari and witness the melding of faith and linguistic expression."

As they approached the entrance of Westcott House, the sound of laughter and excitement echoed through the air. The tourists eagerly chatted amongst themselves, eager to experience the secrets hidden within the walls of the historic venue.

Julian led the way, his gait exuding confidence and charisma, while Sandy, ever the attentive companion, walked alongside the tourists, ensuring their comfort and answering their curious questions.

Upon entering the grand hall, the tourists were immediately captivated by the sight that unfolded before them. Vibrant colours adorned the room, with draperies and decorations reflecting the spirit of the ceremony we were about to witness.

Julian stood at the front, addressing the us with his theatrical flair. "Gillies and flatties, welcome to the heart of the Polari Christian ceremony. Prepare to witness a fusion of language, faith, and tradition, where the barriers of expression are broken down."

The tourists gazed in awe at the intricate details and the palpable energy that permeated the room. As the ceremony was about to commence, Julian and Sandy found discreet positions within the crowd, blending in seamlessly. From their hidden vantage points, they observed the participants in their resplendent costumes, ready to share the magic of Polari with their guests.

Excitement buzzed through the air as the room fell into a hushed silence. Julian's voice, tinged with admiration, resonated in Sandy's ear, "Sandy, my dear, it's moments like these that remind us why we do what we do. The connection between language, culture, and faith is truly extraordinary."

Sandy nodded in agreement, a sense of pride swelling within him. "Absolutely, Julian. This ceremony bridges gaps and fosters understanding. It's an opportunity for our tourists to witness the beauty of a language once marginalized but now celebrated."

With bated breath, we and our dynamic duo awaited the unfolding of the Polari Christian ceremony, eager to embark on a journey that would challenge their preconceptions and ignite their sense of wonder.

In the beginning Gloria created the heaven and the earth.

And the earth was nanti form, and void; and munge was upon the eke of the deep. And the fairy of Gloria trolled upon the eke of the aquas.

And Gloria cackled, Let there be sparkle: and there was sparkle.

And Gloria vardad the sparkle, that it was bona: and Gloria medzered the sparkle from the munge.

And Gloria screeched the sparkle journo, and the munge she screeched nochy. And the bijou nochy and the morning were the first journo.

And Gloria cackled, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the aquas, and let it divide the aquas from the aquas.

And Gloria made the firmament, and medzered the aquas which were under the firmament from the aquas which were above the firmament: and it was so.

And Gloria screeched the firmament Heaven. And the bijou nochy and the morning were the second journo.

And Gloria cackled, Let the aquas under the heaven be gathered together unto una place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

From their hidden vantage points within the crowd, Julian and Sandy observed the Polari Christian rituals unfold before their fascinated eyes. The room was filled with a palpable sense of reverence and excitement, as the participants prepared to showcase their faith and linguistic heritage.

A soft melody filled the air, and the tourists leaned in closer, eager to catch every nuance of the ceremony. The Polari language, with its colourful vocabulary and unique expressions, danced upon the lips of the participants, their voices carrying the weight of tradition and pride.

As the ceremony reached its pinnacle, Julian and Sandy noticed tears welling up in the eyes of some tourists. The power of this experience had touched their souls, transcending language barriers and connecting them to the essence of human expression.

After the final ritual was performed, applause erupted, filling the room with a crescendo of appreciation. Julian and Sandy joined in, clapping wholeheartedly, their hearts brimming with gratitude for being part of this remarkable journey.

As the tourists made their way back to the Crocus, their faces radiated joy and wonder. Julian and Sandy, proud of the impact the ceremony had made, shared smiles of fulfilment. They knew that they had succeeded in providing a glimpse into a world that challenged stereotypes and celebrated diversity.

Gathering their group, Julian addressed the tourists, his voice filled with warmth. "Ladies and gentlemen, what you have vadad today is a testament to the resilience and beauty of the Polari language and its integration with faith. This ceremony has touched our hearts and souls, and we hope it has done the same for you."

Sandy chimed in, his voice full of enthusiasm. "Indeed, we have been privileged to take you on this extraordinary journey. Remember, diversity is a gift, and embracing different languages and cultures can only enrich our lives."

As the tourists boarded the Montrell Cheat, their minds abuzz with newfound knowledge and appreciation, Julian and Sandy exchanged a contented glance.
