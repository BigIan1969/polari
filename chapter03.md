Chapter 3. Polari Grammar
=========================

Nouns, pronouns and names
-------------------------

Nouns and pronouns are an important part of any language, and Polari is no exception. Here are some of the most common nouns and pronouns used in Polari:

Nouns:

- Cartes: Penis

- Dilly: Prostitute

- Dish: Attractive man or buttocks

- Dosh: Money

- Drag: Clothes

- Gelt: Money

- Lallies: Legs

- Lattie: House, Flat or room.

- Omipalone: Gay man

- Pots: Teeth

- Strilla: Pianist

Pronouns:

- I, Me: Mother

- You: You

- Him: She

- Her: He

- It: A sexual partner

- Us: We

- Them: Them/They

- Duchess: VIP

In Polari, pronouns are used much like they are in English, to refer to people or things in the context of a sentence. Nouns are used to describe people, things, or concepts, and can often have multiple meanings or connotations depending on the context in which they are used.

In Polari pronouns are often reversed so He becomes She and vice versa.  It is also important to remember that joining the LGBT community in a time when it was illegal to be gay was more like an induction or an initiation normally involving being given a new name.  This wasn't always done in an affectionate way as often if a new member was seen as too pretty or too full of themselves their compatriots would select a dull name to take them down a peg or two.  Trust me when I explained this for the first time while giving a talk on Polari the delegates immediately seized on the idea and christened me Deirdre (And it stuck).

When using the self-referential pronoun Mother it is common practice to phrase it in the 3<sup>rd</sup> person so for example "I want to go out to dinner" becomes "Mother wants to go out for dinner"

As with any language, the best way to become familiar with Polari nouns and pronouns is through practice and exposure to the language in use.  Remember for better or worse your Polari name is selected by your Polari speaking friends I hope they're not as catty as mine.

Adjectives and adverbs
----------------------

Adjectives and adverbs are important parts of speech in Polari, as they allow for more descriptive and nuanced communication.

Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns or pronouns. In Polari, adjectives are often used to express approval or disapproval, and they can be used in both positive and negative contexts.

Here are some common adjectives and adverbs in Polari:

- Bona: Good, nice

- Butch: Masculine, manly

- Omi-palone: Homosexual, gay

- Palone: Female, woman

- Naff: Dull, boring, straight

- Scarper: Run away, escape

- Camp: Flamboyant, effeminate

- Riah: Hair

Note that some words in Polari can function as both nouns and adjectives, depending on their usage in a sentence. Also, while some Polari words have specific meanings, their usage can often be quite fluid and open to interpretation in different contexts.

Verbs and tenses
----------------

Polari has a simple tense system. The present tense is formed by using the base verb, and the past tense is usually formed by adding the suffix '-ed'. There is no separate form for future tense, instead, 'will' or 'shall' is often added before the base verb to indicate future action.

Here are some commonly used verbs in Polari:

- Charper: To spy or eavesdrop.

- Dilly: To prostitute oneself

- Zoosh: To style hair

- Shush: To steal

- Troll: To walk/stroll about potentially looking for sex

- Vada: To see or look.

Examples of verb usage in Polari:

"I can't believe you didn't vada that Charpering Omi lurking over there." (I cannot believe you didn't notice that police officer lurking over there.)

"I heard he's been dilling on the docks again." (I heard he's been prostituting himself on the docks again.)

"I'm going to troll down to the bodega to get some groceries." (I'm going to walk down to the shop to get some groceries.)

"I need to zoosh my riah before the party tonight." (I need to style my hair before the party tonight.)

"Be careful, he'll shush your wallet if you're not vadaring." (Be careful, he'll steal your wallet if you're not watching.)

"Let's go for a troll around the park and see if we can vada any dolly omis." (Let's go for a walk around the park and see if we can spot any cute guys.)

Suffixes
--------

Polari makes use of various suffixes to modify the meaning of words. Two common suffixes are "ette" and "ola".

"ette" is a diminutive suffix, used to indicate smallness or cuteness. For example, "bevy" means "drink", so "bevyette" would mean a small drink.

"ola" is a derogatory suffix, used to indicate inferior quality or substandard items. For example, "jary" means "food" or "to eat", so "jaryola" would mean a bad meal or food of poor quality.

Add to this that many Polari words can be followed by the words Cheat or Fake/Fakement to indicate that that something is taken away/stolen in the former or something is artificial in the case of the latter.  For example baby is a "Lullaby Cheat" because they steal sleep whereas an earring is an "Aunty Nelly Fake"

With these suffixes, Polari speakers can modify words to convey different meanings and shades of nuance. However, it's important to use them correctly and in the appropriate contexts to avoid confusion or misunderstandings.

Julian and Sandy: Mother Clap's Molly House
-------------------------------------------

Welcome back, dear travellers, to another adventure with Julian and Sandy, on behalf of The Crocus, as we journey through time to the 1720s. Today, we find ourselves in the heart of Holborn, at the infamous Molly House, known as "Mother Clap's."

As we step out of the Montrel Cheat and onto the cobbled streets, we are transported back in time to a world of secrecy, scandal, and rebellion. Molly Houses were clandestine establishments where men could gather to socialize, dance, and engage in intimate activities with other men, away from the prying eyes of society. Molly houses were known for their fake marriage ceremonies, where men would dress up as women and exchange vows in mock ceremonies. These ceremonies allowed gay men to express their love for one another in a time when it was illegal and punishable by death.

Julian and Sandy lead us through the dimly lit corridors, decorated with colourful ribbons and flowers, to the main gathering room. Here, we see men dressed in flamboyant outfits, laughing, and drinking together, enjoying the freedom that the Molly House provides.

Sandy explains that Mother Clap's was one of the most famous Molly Houses in London and was even raided by the Orderly Daughters in 1726. The men were rounded up and put on trial, resulting in many being hanged or transported to the colonies. However, this did not deter the thriving underground culture, and Molly Houses continued to exist until the 19th century.

Julian and Sandy regale us with tales of the famous visitors to Mother Clap's, including the painter William Hogarth, who famously painted a series of satirical engravings depicting the decadent and debauched world of the Molly Houses.

As we bid farewell to Mother Clap's, we are left with a newfound appreciation for the bravery of those who dared to live their lives authentically, despite the dangers they faced. Julian and Sandy remind us that though times have changed, there is still a need for acceptance and tolerance towards those who may be different from ourselves.

We step back into the Montrel Cheat, feeling grateful for this eye-opening journey through time, and eager to see where our next adventure with Julian and Sandy will take us.
