Chapter 4. Conversational Polari
================================

Making small talk
-----------------

Making small talk is an important part of any conversation, and Polari is no exception. Here are some common phrases and expressions that can help you break the ice and start a conversation:

- "Bona Vada" - This is a common greeting in Polari and can be used in both formal and informal settings it essentially means nice to see you.

- "That's bona drag you're wearing" - This means "That's a nice outfit you're wearing."

- "Are you trolling down the bungery for swift bevie?" -- Means "Are you coming down the pub for a pint?"

- "Vada the omie in the dinge chimey I wonder if she's trade?" -- Means "Look at the guy in the dark shirt I wonder if he's available (Sexually)?"

Remember, small talk is all about finding common ground and building a rapport with the person you're speaking with. Be genuine and listen actively to what they have to say, and you'll be on your way to a great conversation in no time!

Ordering food and drinks
------------------------

While Polari was not commonly used to order food and drink, it was often used to surreptitiously discuss the other patrons, waiters, and bar staff without their knowledge. Here are some examples:

- "That omi over there with the cackle and the comb over is giving me the creeps." (Translation: "That man over there with the loud laugh and the bad hairstyle is making me uncomfortable.")

- "Do you think the bona waiter has any naff managarie we should avoid?" (Translation: "Do you think the good waiter has any bad dishes we should steer clear of?")

- "Did you see the vada on that barmaid? She's got a lovely pair of willets." (Translation: "Did you see the look on that female bartender? She's got a nice pair of breasts.")

- "I'm not sure about that naff bloke at the end of the bar. She looks like he might be betty bracelets." (Translation: "I'm not sure about that bad man at the end of the bar. He looks like he might be a cop.")

Remember, while Polari was once used as a secret language to communicate discreetly in public, it is no longer commonly used. If you're in a restaurant or bar and would like to order food or drinks, it's best to use the language of the establishment you're in.

Making plans and appointments
-----------------------------

In Polari, making plans and appointments involves using various phrases and slang terms. Here are some examples:

- "Let's meet at the Bungery at six" - This means, "Let's meet at the pub at six."

- "I'll give you a tinkle on the Polaripipe later" - This means, "I'll call you on the phone later."

- "We'll have to cancel our Ruby Murray, I'm feeling a bit Tom and Dick" - This means, "We'll have to cancel our curry, I'm feeling a bit sick."

- "Are you free on Sunday, or are you hanging with your bona omi?" - This means, "Are you free on Sunday, or are you spending time with your boyfriend?"

- "I'm afraid I can't make it, I'm acting dickie" - This means, "I'm afraid I can't make it, I'm working."

- "Let's vada at the new club in Soho" - This means, "Let's check out the new club in Soho."

- "How about we grab a jarry at the Carnish Ken before the show?" - This means, "How about we have a meal at the restaurant before the show?"

Some important terms to understand:

- Jarry, Manage or Managery, Munge or Mungerey -- Food or to eat.

- Beverage, Bevy -- Drink.

- Bungery -- Pub or Bar.

- Carnish Ken -- Restaurant or Takeaway.

- Polaripipe - Telephone

Using these terms can help you to make plans and appointments in a more discreet way, which was especially useful in the past when homosexuality was illegal in the UK and Polari was used by gay men as a secret language.

Julian & Sandy: In the Navy
---------------------------

Julian and Sandy stepped out of the Montrel Cheat and onto the deck of a 1960s British Merchant Navy ship. They took a deep breath, feeling the salt air fill their lungs. "Welcome aboard, darlings!" Sandy said, smiling at the group of us following behind them.

As they led us around the ship, they introduced us to the crew, all of whom spoke Polari. "This is our mate, Roger," Julian said, gesturing to a sailor with a cheeky grin. "He's a bona dishy bloke, and he knows all the slang of the sea."

Roger greeted us warmly, and Julian and Sandy translated some of his Polari phrases for us. They pointed out the different areas of the ship, from the bridge to the galley to the crew's quarters, and showed us how the crew communicated with each other using Polari.

They told us stories of the crew's adventures at sea, and how they relied on Polari to communicate secretly among themselves. "You never know who might be listening in," Sandy said with a wink.

As the tour came to an end, Julian and Sandy invited us to join the crew for a meal in the galley. We sat around a long table, sharing stories and jokes, and learning even more Polari phrases from the sailors.

As we said our goodbyes and prepared to leave the ship, Julian and Sandy hugged us and thanked us for coming along on the tour. "Remember, darlings," Julian said with a smile. "Polari is a language of community, of belonging, and of love. And it's up to all of us to keep it alive."
